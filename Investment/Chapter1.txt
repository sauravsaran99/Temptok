6. The Stock Markets


1. For those who are not aware, NASSCOM is a trade association of Indian IT companies.

2. Absolute Return – This is return that your trade or investment has generated in absolute terms. It helps you answer this question – I bought Infosys at 3030 and sold it 3550. How much percentage return did I generate?

The formula to calculate the same is [Ending Period Value / Starting Period Value – 1]*100

i.e [3550/3030 -1] *100

= 0.1716 * 100

= 17.16%

A 17.6% is not a bad return at all!

3. Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) – An absolute return can be misleading if you want to compare two investments. CAGR helps you answer this question – I bought Infosys at 3030 and held the stock for 2 years and sold it 3550. At what rate did my investment grow over the last two years?

CAGR factors in the time component which we had ignored when we computed the absolute return.

The formula to calculate CAGR is ..

CAGR

Applying this to answer the question..
   CAGR = [Ending Period Value / Starting Period Value]^(1/[# of years]) – 1
{[3550/3030]^(1/2) – 1} = 8.2%


{
4. An investor is a person who buys a stock expecting a significant appreciation in the stock. He is willing to wait for his investment to evolve. The typical holding period of investors usually runs into a few years. There are two popular types of investors..

4.1 Growth Investors – The objective here is to identify companies which are expected to grow significantly because of emerging industry and macro trends. A classic example in the Indian context would be buying Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, Gillette India back in 1990s. These companies witnessed huge growth because of the change in the industry landscape thereby creating massive wealth for its shareholders.'

4.2 Value Investors – The objective here is to identify good companies irrespective of whether they are in growth phase or mature phase but beaten down significantly due to the short term market sentiment thereby making a great value buy. An example of this in recent times is L&T. Due to short term negative sentiment; L&T was beaten down significantly around August/September of 2013. The stock price collapsed to 690 all the way from 1200. At 690 (given its fundamentals around Aug 2013), a company like L&T is perceived as cheap, and therefore a great value pick. Eventually it did pay off, as the stock price scaled back to 1440 around May 2014.
Some of the really famous investors the world has seen – Charlie Munger, Peter Lynch, Benjamin Graham, Thomas Rowe, Warren Buffett, John C Bogle, John Templeton, etc.

12. Key Events and Their Impact on Markets

1. The monetary policy is a tool with which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) controls the money supply by controlling the interest rates.

2. Repo Rate – Whenever banks want to borrow money, they can borrow from the RBI. The rate at which RBI lends money to other banks is called the repo rate. Markets don’t like the RBI increasing the repo rates.

3. An increase in reverse repo rate is not great for the economy as it tightens the supply of money.

4. Cash reserve ratio (CRR) – Every bank is mandatorily required to maintain funds with RBI. The amount that they maintain is dependent on the CRR. If CRR increases, then more money is removed from the system, which is not good for the economy.

5. There are two types of inflation indices – Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI).

6. The RBI’s challenge is to strike a balance between inflation and interest rates. Usually, a low-interest rate tends to increase inflation, and a high-interest rate tends to arrest inflation.

7. The RBI meets every two months to review the rates. This is a key event that the market watches out for. The first to react to rate decisions would be interest-rate sensitive stocks across various sectors such as – banks, automobile, housing finance, real estate, metals, etc.

8. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP)  is a short-term indicator of how the country’s industrial sector is progressing. The data is released every month (along with inflation data) by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI).

9. If the IIP is increasing it indicates a vibrant industrial environment (as the production is going up) and hence a positive sign for the economy and markets. A decreasing IIP indicates a sluggish production environment, hence a negative sign for the economy and markets.

   * IIP measures industrial production activity. Increase in IIP cheers the markets, and lower IIP disappoints the market.

10. The Purchasing managers’ index (PMI) is an economic indicator that tries to capture business activity across the country’s manufacturing and service sectors. The data is released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI).

   * PMI is a survey-based business sentiment indicator. The PMI number oscillates around the 50 marks. Above 50 is good news to markets, and PMI below 50 is not.

11. The PMI number usually oscillates around 50. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, and below 50 indicates a contraction in the economy. And reading at 50 indicates no change in the economy.

12. Corporate Earnings Announcement

01	April to June	Quarter 1 (Q1)	1st week of July
02	July to September	Quarter 2 (Q2)	1st week of Oct
03	October to December	Quarter 3 (Q3)	1st Week of Jan
04	January to March	Quarter 4 (Q4)	1st Week of April

13. Monetary policy is one of the most important economic events. During the monetary policy, review actions on a repo, reverse repo, CRR etc. are initiated.

14. Inflation data is released every month by MOSPI. As a consumer, CPI inflation data is what you need to track.
